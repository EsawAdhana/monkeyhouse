# MonkeyHouse

Find your perfect intern roommate.

## What is this?

MonkeyHouse matches you with other interns looking for housing in the same area. Fill out a quick survey about your preferences, and we'll show you people who are  compatible with your budget, timeline, and lifestyle.

## How it works

1. **Sign in** with your Google account
2. **Complete the survey** - takes about 2 minutes
3. **Browse your matches** - sorted by compatibility
4. **Message people** - start a conversation directly in the app

## The survey asks about

- Where you want to live (Bay Area, Seattle, NYC, etc.)
- Your internship dates
- Monthly budget range
- How many roommates you want
- Lifestyle stuff (pets, parties, guests, etc.)

## Matching

MonekyHouse calculates compatibility based on:
- Overlapping cities and regions
- Budget ranges that work together
- Timeline overlap (at least 75% of your dates need to match)
- Similar lifestyle preferences

If you're interning at the same company, you'll get a boost in the rankings.
